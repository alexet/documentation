Sensor coverage is the metric which we use to identify the extent to which we cover your environment and thus the effectiveness.
It is key to ensure you have a high or full coverage of your enterprise so every asset is protected.
This is measured via three key indicators:

## Endpoint Installations

The amount of endpoints that have the sensor installed.

## Detection Sensitivity

The detection sensitivity is the confidence factor of detections.
As a new client you typically start with a low detection level to prevent a large amount of false positives, but this is increased as soon as possible to detect more advanced or niche scenarios.

## Prevention Sensitivity

Whenever a detection is raised, the prevention level indicates the confidence level of Falcon to actually kill or stop the attack.
Again as a new client, you typically start with a low prevention level to ensure no valid business processes are interrupted.
This is then carefully increased and followed-up upon by IRON.
Having a prevention level set means threats can be stopped within the second without relying on human intervention.
